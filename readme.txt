======================================
CouponCodes v1.5
======================================
So, what is this repo for if there is already one for the current coupon codes?
-Well, I decided to re-write the plugin because the way I had it before it was messy and hard to add things,
-this new version will only include a few new key features, but for the most part, there won't be too much
-of a change for the users.

What is new in 1.5?
-At the moment, here is the new stuff added:
- You can now give coupon specific permissions (i.e. coupon.donate551 will let you redeem code that code)
- Reloading the config now works properly :D
- Lots of potential bugs have been fixed with this new code
