Feel free to fork any of my plugins, as long as you don't plagiarize (that word is spelt funny)
Source is here for learning or if you're just bored

Very Important Notes
--------------------
Grammer is essential. Misconceptions that annoy me:

* There, Their, and They're
    * There: The ball fell over there.
    * Their: Hey, that's their ball, not ours!
    * They're: (Combo of They & are) They're taking our ball!

* Often
    * The 't' is fucking silent
    * ['ôf(t)?n](http://www.google.com/search?q=plagerize&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a#hl=en&client=firefox-a&hs=oqy&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&q=often&tbs=dfn:1&tbo=u&sa=X&ei=uSghTpvqGo-cgQeMrcG-Cw&sqi=2&ved=0CCQQkQ4&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&fp=eb047f6cff0a70a1&biw=1280&bih=933)
